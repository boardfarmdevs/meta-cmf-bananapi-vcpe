# Optimizer scenario and experiment suite

## Objective

The suite creates a reproducible pseudo-world in which RF, traffic and policy
are independent axes. It is preparation for policy research and P4 scale
acceptance, not an ML algorithm and not evidence that an unavailable control
has been implemented.

```

The RF values and traffic schedule are evaluator truth. The optimizer may
observe only measurements reported through EasyMesh. It must not read the
world file, wmediumd matrix or intended path as a candidate score.

There are two deliberately separate execution boundaries:

- live/capture/recommend/act use `ControllerObserver` and consume only
  controller-reported facts;
- offline `simulate` uses a declared sensor model to turn a verified golden
  world into `simulated_*` EasyMesh-shaped facts for deterministic policy and
  closed-loop tests.

Synthetic snapshots are marked `simulated://`, explicitly say they are not
live-observer compatible, and cannot promote a live capability. They let the
band policy and accept/reject/ignore response handling be developed before the
hwsim candidate-measurement provider is complete without disguising evaluator
truth as controller evidence.

### Pre-association preference is bounded influence

The recommendation-only `PreAssociationPolicy` expresses the intended
behavior without pretending that EasyMesh supplies a portable probe-blocking
primitive. It suppresses a 2.4 GHz probe response only when prior knowledge
says the client supports 5 or 6 GHz, for at most three seconds and three probes
by default. A preferred-band probe is answered immediately. Reaching either
limit forces a 2.4 GHz response and a 30-second cooldown, so preference cannot
become denial of service. The current capability remains blocked because
OneWifi/hwsim has no accepted per-probe observation/action adapter.

## Checked-in pseudo-worlds

Sources are under `gen/wmediumd/configurator/worlds/`; generated timelines are
under `worlds/golden/`.

| World | Agents / clients | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| stationary | 5 / 10 | passive small-profile control |
| slow walk, layout A | 5 / 20 | ten fixed and ten moving clients crossing several cells |
| slow walk, layout B | 5 / 20 | repeat the identical paths with different Agent placement |
| border hover | 5 / 12 | repeated cell/wall-threshold crossings and ping-pong pressure |
| flash crowd | 5 / 20 | ten clients appear together from 20–50 seconds |
| disappear/reappear | 5 / 12 | per-client liveness and stale-state cleanup |
| fast transit | 5 / 12 | candidate opportunity shorter than a costly roam |
| asymmetric link | 5 / 11 | station-originated SNR is deliberately weaker than AP-originated SNR |
| extender loss/recovery | 5 / 10 | one Agent becomes fully attenuated and later returns |
| small band walk | 5 / 10 | move all ten accepted client roles without increasing lab scale |

The two layouts and ten worlds are small enough to review and deterministic
enough to reuse. They contain complete directed station/Agent fronthaul and
Agent/Agent backhaul values for 2.4, 5 and 6 GHz at each tick. They do not
change meaning after a client roams.

Walls add a fixed 5 dB for each proper straight-line crossing. This deliberately
creates abrupt measurement changes without pretending to model diffraction,
reflection, material or antenna orientation accurately. Seeded shadowing is
available, but the first goldens use zero random shadowing so geometry and wall
effects remain directly explainable.

## Traffic axis

Traffic is defined separately in
`gen/optimizer/scenarios/traffic-profiles.json`:

| Profile | Driver | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| idle keepalive | none | available |
| latency probe | `ping` every 200 ms | available |
| constant load | `iperf3` | specified, not accepted |
| staggered bursty applications | `iperf3` | specified, not accepted |
| synchronized traffic flash crowd | `iperf3` | specified, not accepted |

`traffic-plan` expands a selected matrix case into container-bound command
arrays. It never embeds shell fragments and records its own hash. Execution and
capacity acceptance of the `iperf3` driver remain a separate task, so those
cases stay blocked instead of silently becoming ping tests.

## Build and inspect the matrix

```sh
cd gen/wmediumd/configurator
worlds/build-goldens.sh --check
python3 -m pytest -q

cd ../../optimizer
python3 -m optimizer.cli matrix \
  --spec scenarios/home-suite.json \
  --output scenarios/generated/home-suite.matrix.json
python3 -m pytest -q

jq '.summary, .coverage' scenarios/generated/home-suite.matrix.json
jq -r '.cases[] | select(.status == "blocked") |
  [.id, (.missing_capabilities | join(","))] | @tsv' \
  scenarios/generated/home-suite.matrix.json
```

The initial matrix contains 148 cases: 14 runnable and 134 blocked. It applies
both the ordinary weak-link threshold baseline and the opt-in band-upgrade
baseline to the same RF/traffic cases. The count is not a quality score. It
shows that the Cartesian core and specialized scenario
families exist while preserving the present lab boundary.

Create the runnable stationary latency plan for rev130:

```sh
case_id='cartesian-home--home-five-agent--stationary--latency-probe--threshold-policy--seed-1701'
python3 -m optimizer.cli traffic-plan \
  --matrix scenarios/generated/home-suite.matrix.json \
  --case "$case_id" \
  --bindings scenarios/rev130-small-bindings.json \
  --output /tmp/stationary-latency.traffic.json
jq '{status, duration_ms, events: (.events | length), plan_sha256}' \
  /tmp/stationary-latency.traffic.json
```

The role binding is explicit: gateway, four extenders and ten fixed clients map
to the current rev130 container names. A larger world fails plan compilation
until its additional roles have real containers and a profile is accepted.

## Capability boundaries by scenario family

| Family | Present foundation | Required before a valid live claim |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ordinary client steering | atomic RF, current RCPI, BTM action and association verifier | candidate-link measurements with trustworthy receipt time |
| band steering | per-band worlds, frequency-qualified RF control and band-aware observation/policy schemas | expose BSSID/band inventory plus fresh per-BSSID candidate measurements with receipt time |
| pre-association steering | bounded decision state machine and failsafe semantics | probe-response observation/control adapter |
| BTM `NoDisconnect` | action and outcome model | clients that deterministically accept, reject or ignore BTM |
| load steering | traffic schedules | accepted `iperf3` driver and timestamped AP/BSS load metrics |
| backhaul topology | directed Agent/Agent values in every world | backhaul metric observer and safe topology/band action adapter |
| channel width | location and traffic axes | representative 20/40/80/160 MHz hwsim operation and action adapter |
| scale | generated 5/20 RF worlds | reproducible container manifests and accepted resource envelope |

### Band steering is a BSSID decision

The checked-in world calculates different 2.4, 5 and 6 GHz reach. Patch `0012`
extends wmediumd's live key to `(source radio, destination radio, frequency
MHz)` while retaining the old pair value as fallback. Atomic apply, get, dump,
clear and exact restore are implemented. `world-export --band all` resolves
2.4/5/6 GHz through each Agent's actual live fronthaul frequency and emits all
three conditions in one scenario.

Rev130 proved the frequency boundary on an associated 5180 MHz link: a 25 dB
override moved signal/RCPI from -41 dBm/138 to -66 dBm/88 while a different
2437 MHz override existed for the same pair. Clearing both directions returned
to the original 50 dB pair fallback and -41 dBm/138 without packet loss.

The ten-client small band walk then exercised all three bands together for 30
ticks. The 60-second plan completed in 60.8 seconds with at most 65.3 ms apply
lateness, restored all 300 touched frequency keys and left the 5/15/50
controller model and all 10 WLAN associations complete. This accepts the RF
stimulus path at the current small profile; it does not claim an optimizer made
band decisions.

The optimizer then ranks target BSSIDs using reported candidate measurements.
It does not simply choose the label “5 GHz” or “6 GHz.” A 2.4-to-5 or 5-to-6
case remains blocked until both RF and measurement requirements exist.

`band-upgrade-policy.yaml` is the first conservative, explainable baseline. It
normalizes the EasyMesh band enumeration (0=2.4, 1=5, 3=6 GHz), keeps the exact
source and target BSSID in every score/decision, and considers only a higher
band whose fresh measured RCPI is at least 120 and no more than 8 RCPI (4 dB)
below the current link. The same hold, dwell, pending timeout and cooldown gates
still apply. It deliberately defaults off in `threshold-policy.yaml`.

Those numbers are hypotheses for comparison, not EasyMesh-standard policy
primitives and not a claim that a higher band is always better. Candidate
inventory with an unknown RCPI cannot trigger the policy. The live band cases
therefore remain blocked by candidate measurement and receipt-time capabilities
even though deterministic 2.4/5/6 GHz RF stimulus now works.

The offline closed-loop runner already uses the same policy core against the
small band-walk golden. It assigns deterministic synthetic device, BSSID and
STA identities, converts directed station-to-Agent SNR through an explicit
noise-floor/RCPI sensor model, applies accepted actions to association state,
and leaves rejected or ignored actions unchanged. This tests policy logic and
failure backoff; it does not clear the live candidate-measurement blocker.

The compact `/api/v1/topology` response still omits its fronthaul `BSSList`.
Patch `0068` therefore adds the read-only `/api/v1/bsses` projection from the
controller's serialized `get_sta` tree. Rev130 returns exactly 30 fronthaul
identities: private and IoT BSSs on five devices across bands 0, 1 and 3. The
observer normalizes those as 2.4, 5 and 6 GHz and produces 14 same-SSID target
identities for each associated private client. All 140 candidate RCPI values
remain explicitly unknown; inventory cannot trigger a steer.

### Backhaul topology is a slower, separate loop

Backhaul selection should be represented as a weighted graph whose vertices
are Agents and whose possible edges have band, measured signal/SNR, rates,
retry cost, utilization and stability. A slow optimizer can compare connected,
loop-free trees while penalizing churn and weak upstream bottlenecks. Five or
6 GHz preference and 2.4 GHz failsafe are policy hypotheses, not hard-coded
facts.

The current configurator computes those potential edge values but does not
apply them: `.wmd` export keeps `protect backhaul`. This prevents a client
steering scenario from accidentally partitioning the mesh before a safe
backhaul transaction and verifier exist.

`backhaul-plan` now provides the first recommendation-only baseline. It accepts
fresh observed alternatives for every undirected edge and band, scores SNR,
PHY rate, utilization and retries, applies configurable band bonuses, and uses
a maximum-spanning-tree selection to guarantee a loop-free connected result.
It is not limited to 5 GHz: 6 GHz has a small default preference, 5 GHz remains
preferred over 2.4 GHz, and penalized 2.4 GHz remains a connectivity failsafe.
The actual measurements and transactional topology action remain unavailable,
so this does not promote the live backhaul capability.

### Channel width and field behavior

The current hwsim lab operates at an effective 20 MHz width. Location-specific
40/80/160 MHz policies may be designed and replayed, but throughput claims are
blocked until those widths are represented and measured. Likewise, BTM
`NoDisconnect` is a normal outcome rather than a protocol failure. The
threshold policy now turns an expired pending steer into an explicit
`association_timeout`, applies a 60-second exponentially increasing backoff
(capped at 600 seconds), and preserves the failure count in replay state. Live
deterministic testing remains blocked until clients can be assigned
accept/reject/ignore behavior; the policy already has safe timeout semantics.

`width-plan` is the first recommendation-only width baseline. It can recommend
40 MHz on 2.4 GHz only for a clean low-neighbor location, cap 5 GHz near radar
or high congestion, and prefer 160 MHz on sufficiently clean 6 GHz. Every
result names its reason. The inputs are explicit radio-environment
observations; the command does not mutate OneWifi and cannot support a
throughput claim until representative widths, traffic and a verifier exist.

## Acceptance progression

1. Keep the current 5-Agent/10-client small profile green.
2. Add a traffic executor and accept latency, constant-load and burst evidence.
3. Expose measurement receipt time and real target-BSSID measurements.
4. Run threshold policy in recommend mode against stationary, crossover,
   border and fast-transit cases.
5. Enable exactly one live bounded steering transaction and score its outcome.
6. Generate and accept the 5/20 profile, then medium and stress manifests.
7. **Frequency-qualified RF complete:** keep its apply/readback/restore
   regression mandatory; candidate measurements still gate a band-steering
   policy claim.
8. Add backhaul and width action adapters as separate safety domains.

Every promotion updates `capabilities-current.json`; matrix regeneration then
moves only genuinely supported cases from `blocked` to `runnable`.
