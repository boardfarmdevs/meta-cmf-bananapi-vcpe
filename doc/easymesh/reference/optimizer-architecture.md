# External optimizer architecture

## Purpose and ownership

The steering optimizer is a completely external component. It runs on the lab
host or Vagrant VM, outside every BPI container and outside the EasyMesh,
OneWifi, WebUI and wmediumd processes.

For installation, operating commands, input schemas, adapter examples and
policy extension, use the companion [optimizer user and extension
manual](../experiments/optimizer-development.md).

The optimizer owns all optimization behavior:

- measurement interpretation and freshness rules;
- candidate construction, filtering, ranking and scoring;
- thresholds, margins, hysteresis, dwell and cooldown;
- per-client state and outstanding transactions;
- whether, when and where to steer; and
- decision, action and outcome records.

The BPI EasyMesh implementation supplies protocol facts and mechanisms only:

- topology, association, capability and measurement reports;
- standardized measurement queries and responses;
- Policy Configuration transport for reporting and exclusions;
- Client Steering Request transport, 1905 ACK and steering reports; and
- the OneWifi/HAL path that transmits BTM and reports reassociation.

It supplies no optimizer, target recommendation, candidate score, threshold
evaluation or steering trigger. Agent-local steering must be explicitly disabled
for controller-optimizer experiments so the external optimizer is the only
decision maker.

```

The absence of a decision edge from wmediumd or the BPI agents to the decision
engine is intentional. wmediumd knows the simulated truth, and the BPI agents
know local protocol state, but neither selects the target for this experiment.

## Interface contracts

| Interface | Producer | Consumer | Contract now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RF generation | `wmdcfg` | wmediumd | Atomic radio-pair SNR generations with verified restore |
| RF transport | wmediumd | hwsim | Frequency-isolated simulated frame delivery |
| live topology | controller/WebUI | external observer | compact `/api/v1/topology` supplies nodes/client placement; `/api/v1/bsses` supplies controller-owned fronthaul BSSID/device/radio/band/SSID identity |
| live association | controller/WebUI | external observer/verifier | Parent agent and STA MAC in `/api/v1/topology` and `/api/v1/clients` |
| current-link metrics | EasyMesh reports/queries | external observer | Live associated-client RCPI/rates/counters are available from `/api/v1/clients` |
| candidate-link metrics | EasyMesh Unassociated STA Link Metrics | external observer | Active same-band query returns timestamped RCPI mapped from Agent/RUID to exact BSSID; hwsim requires explicit simulator opt-in |
| policy baseline | operator/external setup | controller and agents | Reporting/exclusion configuration; local agent steering set to mode 0 |
| steer action | external actuator | controller | `steer.sh STA TARGET_BSSID` at the current implementation stage |
| protocol action | controller | source agent | EasyMesh Client Steering Request in Mandate mode |
| WLAN action | source agent/OneWifi | client | 802.11v BTM Request from the source VAP |
| outcome | client/agent/controller | external verifier | link, BTM/report, model and API must converge |
| experiment truth | runner/client/health audit | recorder only | Scenario events, client link, traffic and restart counters |

### Observation boundary

`/api/v1/topology`, `/api/v1/devices`, `/api/v1/clients` and `/api/v1/bsses`
derive identity, association placement and target BSS identity from the current
controller tree. WebSocket initial state uses the same live inventory.
`/api/v1/clients` joins the controller's detailed associated-STA report by MAC
and exposes real RCPI, derived dBm, rate, counters, association uptime and the
report receipt timestamp. `/api/v1/bsses` deliberately exposes identity rather
than invented quality. The observer actively POSTs
`/api/v1/unassoc_sta_query`, groups clients per Agent radio, and maps each
timestamped response RUID to an exact BSSID. Inventory entries with no response
remain unknown and cannot trigger an action.

The hwsim provider measures at the simulated-radio/HAL boundary and labels the
response simulated. The optimizer accepts it only with an explicit lab-only
flag. The query listens on the channel where a STA currently transmits, so it
provides same-band candidates. Live cross-band policy still needs
Beacon/Probe/capability observations. Performance, interference and other
demonstration endpoints remain non-authoritative and must not be optimizer
inputs.

Native controller code remains an interface adapter: it correlates commands
and exposes measurements, but contains no optimizer state, ranking, target
selection or policy algorithm.

Direct MariaDB and `iw` reads are useful acceptance oracles. They must not
become the durable optimizer API because they bypass the EasyMesh observation
contract being evaluated.

### Action boundary

The current action hook is deliberately narrow:

```text
external actuator
  -> lxc exec bpibroadband -- /usr/bin/steer.sh STA TARGET_BSSID
  -> steer_drv / libemcli
  -> em_ctrl Client Steering Request
```

This path is already proven at scale. The actuator must resolve the current
source and validate the target immediately before execution. A later
authenticated steering API may replace `lxc exec`, but it must preserve the
same transaction and verification semantics.

## External optimizer components

The host-side Python package is:

```text
gen/optimizer/
|-- pyproject.toml
|-- configs/
|   |-- threshold-policy.yaml
|   `-- band-upgrade-policy.yaml
|-- scenarios/
|   |-- capabilities-current.json
|   |-- traffic-profiles.json
|   |-- scenario-catalog.json
|   `-- generated/home-suite.matrix.json
|-- optimizer/
|   |-- cli.py
|   |-- model.py
|   |-- observer.py
|   |-- policy.py
|   |-- state.py
|   |-- actuator.py
|   |-- verifier.py
|   |-- experiments.py
|   |-- traffic.py
|   |-- simulator.py
|   |-- planners.py
|   |-- preassociation.py
|   `-- recorder.py
`-- tests/
```

Its execution modes are:

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `observe` | Collect and record real snapshots; never recommend or steer |
| `recommend` | Run the complete state machine and record decisions; never act |
| `act` | Issue one validated action and verify the complete outcome |
| `evaluate` | Validate and evaluate one team-supplied plain Snapshot v1; never act |
| `replay` | Re-evaluate a hash-chained chronological snapshot journal |
| `simulate` | Run synthetic EasyMesh-shaped telemetry from a verified golden world; never a live claim |
| `backhaul-plan` | Build a recommendation-only weighted loop-free backhaul tree |
| `width-plan` | Produce explained recommendation-only channel-width choices |

The decision core should be a pure function over a snapshot, versioned policy
and prior client state. Network I/O belongs in adapters, not in scoring logic.
This makes recorded inputs replayable in unit tests.

## External policy model

The optimizer policy is its own versioned configuration, not an EasyMesh Policy
Configuration TLV and not a WebUI conservative/balanced/aggressive preset. The
following values illustrate the schema; they are not accepted tuning defaults.

```yaml
policy_version: 1
decision_interval_seconds: 1
current_rcpi_below: 100
minimum_target_gain_rcpi: 16
condition_hold_seconds: 5
minimum_dwell_seconds: 20
steer_timeout_seconds: 10
post_steer_cooldown_seconds: 30
failure_backoff_seconds: 60
maximum_failure_backoff_seconds: 600
maximum_in_flight_per_sta: 1
reject_stale_metrics_after_seconds: 3
```

Configured wmediumd SNR is never substituted for observed RCPI. The two are
different quantities and their relationship must be measured through the
actual Wi-Fi/EasyMesh reporting path.

EasyMesh policy configuration remains useful only to establish the experiment
environment:

- agent-local steering mode `0` so no BPI process makes a steering decision;
- empty local and BTM exclusion lists unless the experiment tests exclusions;
- reporting intervals and inclusion settings needed to obtain raw metrics; and
- no reliance on the misleading WebUI `Add Station Entry` label: per-radio
  settings are keyed by RUID, not client MAC.

## Decision and feedback sequence

```mermaid

        P->>A: Decision(STA, source, target, reason, policy hash)

        E->>E: EasyMesh Steering Request and matching 1905 ACK
        E->>N: OneWifi transmits BTM from source VAP
        N-->>E: Reassociation and BTM response/report
        A->>V: Start bounded verification transaction
        E-->>V: Controller model and API association update
        N-->>V: Client-link and traffic test oracle
        V-->>P: Passed, rejected or timed out
        V-->>J: Per-plane evidence and convergence latency
        P->>P: Enter cooldown or failure backoff
    end

    R->>W: Restore captured medium baseline
    W-->>R: Readback confirms restoration
    R-->>J: Final scenario and restoration result
```

The feedback loop belongs to the external optimizer: it observes the resulting
association and closes its own transaction. It never asks wmediumd whether the
steer should have worked.

## Health and safety gates

The optimizer code inhibits an action unless all of these are true:

- expected five non-controller mesh-device records and 20/20 active clients
  (ten private and ten IoT) are present;
- the STA has one current association and a fresh current-link measurement;
- the target BSSID exists, is not the source and is eligible for the STA;
- candidate measurements are fresh and exceed the configured margin;
- minimum dwell and condition-hold periods are satisfied;
- no steering transaction, failure backoff or cooldown exists for the STA; and
- the operator supplied the explicit act confirmation.

The live test harness must additionally require the complete `5/15/50`
controller model, healthy wmediumd, no controller/agent/OneWifi restart, a
writable journal and complete post-action traffic/model agreement. These are
acceptance gates around the optimizer; the policy does not read wmediumd or
service-manager state.

Missing, contradictory or stale data results in `NO_ACTION`, never an inferred
value or optimistic steer.

## Implementation stages

1. **Associated-link vertical slice — complete.** Live client identities,
   placement and changing reported RCPI are exposed; a reversible wmediumd run
   moved controller RCPI from 138 to 88 and back without injecting a value.
2. **Candidate observation — complete for same-band hwsim.** Correlated target
   facts and per-result receipt time are mapped to exact target BSSIDs.
3. **Recommend mode — implemented.** Replay and live snapshots use the same
   deterministic state machine; the isolated five-AP crossover requires one
   unique target.
4. **Act mode — implemented and explicitly gated.** The proven `steer.sh`
   adapter, bounded verifier, cooldown and failure backoff are in place.
5. **Scale and fault tests.** Twenty clients, four extenders, stale metrics,
   rejected BTM, missing target, delayed model convergence and process loss.
6. **Optional API hardening.** Replace `lxc exec` with authenticated observation
   and steering endpoints without moving optimization logic into the BPI image.

## P1 implementation status

The host-side package in `gen/optimizer` implements immutable Snapshot v1,
controller and candidate adapters, a pure threshold/margin/hold/dwell/cooldown
state machine, plain-JSON evaluation, deterministic replay, a hash-chained
journal, the narrow `gen/steer.sh` actuator and bounded association verifier.
It imports no wmediumd state in its live observation or decision path.

Associated and candidate metrics carry controller receipt times. Candidate
requests are serialized by Agent radio and the controller retires a completed
command synchronously when its correlated response is retained, so an
immediate next request is admitted. Collection failure aborts the complete
snapshot; optional non-acting soak behavior records and skips that cycle rather
than evaluating partial candidates.

### Measurement capability and exposure matrix

| Fact or mechanism | Standard/native implementation | Controller state | External exposure now | P1 disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| current association | topology notifications, Associated Clients repair | current STA owner and BSSID | `/clients` | use now |
| associated-link RCPI/rates/counters | periodic AP Metrics Response and Associated STA Link Metrics | persisted with report receipt time | `/clients` with receipt time | use now with freshness gate |
| AP/BSS utilization | AP Metrics and Radio Metrics TLVs | parser and model fields exist | values reach current model; hwsim HAL reports zero | expose with receipt time, but do not score zero synthetic survey data |
| candidate BSS identity | device/radio/BSS model | BSSList contains target identities | `/bsses` returns 30 fronthaul identities across five devices and three bands | use now; unknown quality remains unknown |
| Unassociated STA Link Metrics | Profile-3 CMDU, OneWifi method/event and hwsim provider | controller correlates MID, Agent/RUID, STA, opclass, channel, RCPI and receipt time | POST `/api/v1/unassoc_sta_query` waits for and returns correlated measurements | use now for same-band hwsim with explicit simulator opt-in |
| Beacon Metrics | query/response handlers and agent RBus beacon-report path exist | raw measurement-report elements are copied into the STA model | no external query/result API and no decoded candidate RCPI | evaluate after unassociated metrics; decode only required fields |
| client capability/BTM support | client capability query/report and reassociation parsing | capability data exists in STA model | not normalized for optimizer filtering | add read-only capability flags |
| steering | Client Steering Request, BTM, ACK/report | proven controller/agent transaction | `gen/steer.sh` | use through narrow actuator |

The next measurement slice is cross-band evidence and client capability, not a
shortcut through scenario truth. Beacon/probe observations must name exact
BSSID/band, source and receipt time before live band-upgrade action is enabled.

### Unassociated-metrics boundary

The implementation separates radio selection/state, RBus method/event,
payload-shape, hwsim-provider, result-correlation and HTTP semantic defects.
The layer repairs each boundary without moving policy into the BPI:

1. controller orchestration selects the requested Agent radio/opclass and
   admits operational radio states;
2. the Agent invokes OneWifi's real per-VAP `GetNaSta` method and consumes
   `Device.WiFi.EM.NaStaResponse`;
3. producer and parser share the flat STA-list contract;
4. hwsim obtains read-only candidate quality at the simulated-radio medium
   boundary and labels the result simulated;
5. controller and Agent correlate message IDs and retain RCPI with receipt
   time; and
6. HTTP waits for a semantic result and returns provider, simulated flag and
   measurements rather than command submission alone.

Multi-Agent collection exposed one additional lifecycle race: the first result
was externally visible before its active orchestrator command was retired. An
immediate second query was silently treated as already in progress and HTTP
returned 504. The controller now completes that command when the correlated
response is retained. This is a generic command-lifecycle correction, not an
optimizer retry workaround.

Scenario preparation is also implemented. Two 2D Agent layouts, ten mobility/
presence worlds and five separate traffic profiles expand into a deterministic
148-case matrix across two policy baselines. The current capability file marks
56 cases capability-runnable and 92 blocked with exact missing mechanisms.
Frequency-qualified RF, metric receipt time and same-band candidate collection
are accepted, as is the five-Agent/20-client mixed profile. Cross-band
evidence, load traffic, controlled BTM response, backhaul actions, channel
width and the 50/100-client profiles must not be inferred from configuration
alone. See [optimizer scenarios](../experiments/optimizer-scenarios.md).

### Test ladder

The optimizer tests intentionally progress in layers:

1. model/MAC/timestamp validation and serialization;
2. observer normalization and the rule that API serialization time is not
   measurement time;
3. missing, stale, threshold, margin, dwell, hold, pending and cooldown policy
   transitions;
4. actuator source/target validation and verifier convergence;
5. hash-chain integrity and byte-deterministic replay; and
6. the existing `two-ap-crossover.wmd` and isolated five-AP phase contracts
   combined with measured-shaped EasyMesh streams, requiring exactly one
   recommendation; and
7. both 2.4-to-5 and 5-to-6 BSSID decisions against the ten-client small band
   world without reading its simulated SNR as policy input.

The crossover test reads the scenario only for phase/timing coordination. Its
RCPI inputs are explicitly labelled Associated STA Link Metrics and Beacon
Metrics observations; it never calculates them from the scenario SNR.

## Acceptance criteria

The first optimizer is accepted on rev130 with:

- recorded policy/scenario hashes and frozen radio bindings;
- real measurement changes preceding the decision;
- exactly one explained steer for the selected STA;
- no unintended agent-local steering;
- client link, BTM/report, controller database and API agreement;
- bounded traffic impact and no service restarts;
- cooldown preventing an immediate return steer;
- verified wmediumd restoration; and
- a complete append-only record sufficient to replay the decision offline.

The WebUI may later display optimizer state or submit external policy files, but
it is never the decision engine. `Optimize Layout`, canned metrics and generic
steering presets remain outside this architecture.
