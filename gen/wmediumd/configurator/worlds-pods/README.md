# Rooms with OpenSync pods

The lab's own rooms (`../worlds`) with two OpenSync pods added as APs. The
pods are unchanged OpenSync devices that the EMOSA adapter (emosa-lab,
`deploy/rdk-lab`) presents to the RDK controller as EasyMesh agents; in the
room they are ordinary `fronthaul_ap` roles, `pod_1` and `pod_2`, bound to the
containers `pod-1` and `pod-2`.

- `golden/`: one pod variant per native Golden World, **same world ID**, so a
  test that addresses a room by ID runs the pod variant against this tree.
- `layouts/NAME-pods.json`: the native layout plus the pods at
  `pod-positions.json`. `mobility` is the native mobility tree.
- `build-goldens.py --check|--write` rebuilds both from the native trees; the
  room tests fail on a stale pod world.

What the pods change and what they do not:

- A pod serves 2.4 GHz only (its fronthaul radio). Its links on 5 and 6 GHz
  are skipped by the compiler (`adapter` in the inventory); its backhaul to the
  adapter's tunnel point is a fixed link outside the room
  (`user.wmediumd.links`, see `doc/easymesh/reference/radio/wmediumd-internals.md`).
- The controller's model gains one device, one radio and one BSS per operating
  AP interface per pod, and no backhaul station; the compiled plan describes
  them in `expected_lab.adapter_devices`, and every health check adds them.
- The pod variant is selected by manifest only:
  `gen/demo/manifests/private-client-room-walk-pods.json` (`worlds_root`
  points here). Run the room service with
  `EASYMESH_ROOM_MANIFEST=gen/demo/manifests/private-client-room-walk-pods.json`
  and the suite with `EASYMESH_ROOM_WORLDS_ROOT=gen/wmediumd/configurator/worlds-pods`.
  Without them everything is as before.
