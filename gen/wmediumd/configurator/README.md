# wmediumd configurator

This directory contains the scenario-language implementation described in
[the wmediumd configurator reference](../../../doc/easymesh/reference/wmediumd-configurator.md).

Python 3.8 or newer is supported so the offline compiler and tests can also run
on the rev140 build host; live inventory and execution still run inside the lab
VM that owns the LXD/hwsim topology.

The current `0.1` increment implements parsing, validation, live LXD/hwsim
inventory, frozen role binding, deterministic event-plan compilation, and live
execution through wmediumd's dedicated atomic control socket. Every generation
is read back, the captured baseline is restored on normal exit or a handled
interrupt, and ramps never restart wmediumd.

The `worlds/` front end adds deterministic 2D layouts, physical role paths,
presence intervals, directed link asymmetry, fixed-loss walls and per-band
golden timelines. It can export one backward-compatible pair projection or all
bands into the auditable `.wmd` language. Patch `0012` applies the all-band form
as frequency-qualified overrides with exact readback and restore. This creates
valid band-specific RF stimulus; the external optimizer still needs reported
target-BSSID measurements before it can make a band-steering decision.

Run directly from the source tree:

```sh
cd gen/wmediumd/configurator
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 -m wmdcfg.cli inventory -o /tmp/inventory.json
python3 -m wmdcfg.cli compile scenarios/two-ap-crossover.wmd \
    --inventory /tmp/inventory.json \
    --bind client=wlan-client \
    --bind ap_a=bpibroadband \
    --bind ap_b=bpiap \
    -o /tmp/two-ap-crossover.plan.json
python3 -m wmdcfg.cli status
python3 -m wmdcfg.cli run /tmp/two-ap-crossover.plan.json \
    --output-root /tmp/wmdcfg-runs

worlds/build-goldens.sh --check
python3 -m wmdcfg.cli world-export \
    worlds/golden/home-a-stationary.world.json \
    --band all -o /tmp/home-a-stationary-all.wmd
```

Every station/AP pair declared by the scenario must be initialized in its first
phase. Bindings are frozen to hwsim transmitter identities (`permanent | 0x40`)
and never follow the client's association.

RDK presents its 2.4, 5 and 6 GHz logical radios as VIFs on one hwsim PHY. The
inventory records that one permanent identity plus all three frequency
contexts. An unqualified station/AP link follows the station's band at compile
time and becomes a frequency-qualified update. Consequently frame delivery,
associated signal, and the HAL's candidate-link provider all observe the same
scenario value without affecting the other two bands.

For a two-minute visual check of live RCPI reporting, the wrapper discovers the
selected client's current serving AP, oscillates only that RF link, samples
`/api/v1/clients`, and restores the captured medium state:

```sh
./run-rcpi-monitor.sh wlan-client
```

The end-to-end policy acceptance is:

```sh
../../tests/optimizer-dynamic.sh recommend wlan-client-007 bpiap-001
../../tests/optimizer-dynamic.sh act wlan-client-007 bpiap-001
```

Keep the WebUI **Connected Clients** tab open during the run. Its Signal column
refreshes every two seconds and shows both dBm and raw RCPI. The wrapper keeps
traffic flowing to `10.0.0.1` so hwsim reports each current phase; set
`WMD_TRAFFIC_TARGET` to use a different reachable address.

The runner requires a complete EasyMesh topology and all expected WLAN clients
to be active at preflight and postflight. It checks WebUI topology/client counts
and the controller's authoritative device/radio/BSS/association counts. Each
generation obtains all client BSSID/RCPI observations with one controller query,
so observation cost does not distort a multi-client RF timeline. Run artifacts
contain the frozen plan, every applied generation and observation, health
snapshots, verified restore, and a machine-readable summary.
